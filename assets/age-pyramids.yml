description: Age distribution in Metropolitan France from 1901 to 2021.
notes:
  - Data from 2018 to 2021 is provisional
  - Age column is generational age (for example in 2021, age 0 means "born in 2020").
    We know that because on the interactive website, when hovering over age 0,
    it displays "Ann√©e de naissance 2020"
